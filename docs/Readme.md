<H1> First Aid Order Database <H1/>

Project Description
This database project is designed to manage a small business's inventory and order processing system for first aid products. It tracks product inventory, customer information, order details, and shipment tracking to ensure smooth operations from purchase to delivery. The database also sets the foundation for future customer service tracking.

## Purpose
The purpose is to provide a structured system for managing orders, inventory stock levels, customer details, and shipment information. My eventual goal is to support efficient customer relationship management.

## Technology Used
- MySQL / MYSQL WorkBench
- Git / Github

1. Ensure you have a compatible SQL database server (such as MySQL workbench) installed.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine (GITHUB Desktop)
3. Navigate to the `/sql` folder
6. Use the scripts in this folder to perform queries.
