<H1> First Aid Order Database <H1/>

Project Description
This database project is for the SQL database of a first aid business complete with mockdata.

## Purpose
The purpose is to provide a structured database for managing orders, inventory stock levels, customer details, and shipment information. My eventual goal is to support efficient customer relationship management.

## Technology Used
- MySQL / MYSQL WorkBench
- Git / Github

1. Ensure you have a compatible SQL database server (such as MySQL workbench) installed.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine (GITHUB Desktop)
3. Navigate to the `/sql` folder
6. Use the scripts in this folder to perform queries.
