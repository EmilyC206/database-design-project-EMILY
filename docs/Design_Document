DESIGN DOCUMENT

There are a total of 4 tables: 
- Shipment
- Customer
- Inventory
- Order Processing

Shipment would be 1:1 with Order Processing. 
Customer matches 1:Many with Shipment
Inventory is 1:1 with order processing
Order Processing is 1:Many with Shipment and Customer

I got rid of the permissions table as I will be using mock data. The only permissions class would be myself.
There are also some future tables I would like to build in future revisions such as customer service. I wrote out a table utilizing dedicated customer service staff in the future.
